    <h1>How Physically Active is the Australian Population?</h1>
    <p>Maintaining good health is essential to living a fulfilling life, and regular physical activity plays a key role in achieving that. 
      Engaging in exercise not only strengthens the body but also enhances mental well-being, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, 
      and improves overall quality of life. Which is why we will be exploring the physical activity levels across Australia, 
      providing insights into how often people in different states and age groups engage in regular exercise. 
      By understanding these trends, we can identify areas for improvement and encourage healthier lifestyles for all Australians.

          <p class="description">In this map, we take a look at the percentage of the population in each of Australia's states
            who exercise more than 3 times a week form the year 2018 to 2023. This is due to the fact that exercising 3 times a week is a
            general consensus as to the recommended amount to exercise in a week. As we can see, in 2023, Australian
            Capital Territory (ACT) is the state with the highest participation rate out of the population with 
            67.9%, while Northern Territory (NT) is the lowest with 51.2%. Seeing the change throughout the years, we see that
            Northern Territory (NT) went from having the highest participation rate to the lowest. It is also apparent that after the year 2020,
            which is when COVID-19 happened, the participation rate has gradually decreased overall. Let's break it down further and see how
            the different age groups and gender contribute to the participation rate in 2023.

            This graph illustrates the participation rates in physical activities across Australian states, broken down by age groups. 
            Each bar represents a state, with different segments indicating the percentage of people in each age group who engage in physical activities. 
            The shades of color correspond to specific age ranges, from 15-17 years old at the top (lightest) to 65+ years old at the bottom (darkest). 
            Notably, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Northern Territory (NT) are the only states where the largest contributor is the age group of 25-34, 
            while other states all have the age group of 65+ contributing the most to the participation rate. This could be due to the fact that with higher age groups,
            they are more likely to be retired, therefore allowing them to find more time to exercise. Another reason is that at that age, people tend to recognize how 
            beneficial exercise is for their health.

            The different donut charts represent the breakdown for the participation rate in each state by gender across Australian states.
            It is apparent that for most of the states, <span class="f">females</span> contribute more to the participation rate compared to their <span class="m">male</span> conterparts,
            with the only exceptions being Northern Territory (NT) and Southern Australia (SA). This article:
